          <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a Full Sail University graduate with an A.A.S in Digital Art
            and Design, currently pursuing a degree in Web Development at Full
            Sail University. I am passionate about combining art, design, and
            coding to create websites that are not only visually appealing but
            also fully functional. Growing up as the youngest of seven in a Navy
            Family, I was homeschooled alongside my siblings, which instilled in
            me discipline, adaptability, and a love for learning. I enjoy
            designing, problem-solving, and building digital experiences that
            blend creativity with technical skill.
